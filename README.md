This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is mostly to practice the newer features of React, such as Hooks, Reducers, Context and etc.
Other than Styled-Components, no additional libraries were used.

Might be a good idea for a full fledge application in the future, just haven't found a use yet!

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
